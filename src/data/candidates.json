    "riskFactors": "The primary risk factor is the applicant's low credit score of 610, which indicates a significant risk of default and a history of credit challenges. While the debt-to-income ratio (0.2) is favorable and income of $75,000 suggests repayment capacity, the poor credit history heavily outweighs these mitigating factors for an unsecured loan of this amount.",

    "riskFactors": "Martyn presents a low credit risk due to a strong credit score (720), highly stable government employment, a robust annual income of $75,000, and an exceptionally low debt-to-income ratio of 0.3. These factors collectively indicate a high likelihood of timely repayment.",
